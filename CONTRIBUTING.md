# Contributing

The team welcomes contributions!  To make code changes to one of the Conjure repos:

- Fork the repo and make a branch
- Write your code (ideally with tests) and make sure the CircleCI build passes
- Open a PR

## Local development

1. Fork the repository: `git@github.com:palantir/assertj-automation.git`
1. Run `./gradlew openIdea` to generate and open an IntelliJ ipr file

_Note: development on Mac and Linux should be well supported, but as we currently don't test on Windows, there may be rough edges._
