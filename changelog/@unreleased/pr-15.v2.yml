    Add isEmpty String error prone check

    ## Before this PR
    isEqualTo("") and isNotEqualTo("") are allowed

    ## After this PR
    They are changed to isEmpty() and isNotEmpty()

    ## Possible downsides?
    isEmpty also checks null, so we are now matching another case. I'm guessing that assertThat(aNullString).isNotEqualTo("") was a bug to begin with though.
